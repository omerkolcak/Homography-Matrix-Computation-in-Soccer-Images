# Homography-Matrix-Computation-in-Soccer-Images
## Project Overview
In this project, homography matrix is caluclated between the soccer images and 2D soccer model. This project is made for EEE4512 Image Processing class. Details of the 
project can be found in the [report](https://github.com/omerkolcak/Homography-Matrix-Computation-in-Soccer-Images/blob/master/EEE4512%20-%20Report.pdf).
